=head1 NAME

App::Netdisco::JobQueue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Interface for Netdisco job queue.

There are no default exports, however the C<:all> tag will export all
subroutines.

=head1 EXPORT_OK

=head2 jq_getsome( $num? )

Returns a list of randomly selected queued jobs. Default is to return one job,
unless C<$num> is provided. Jobs are returned as objects which implement the
Netdisco job instance interface (see below).

=head2 jq_locked()

Returns the list of jobs currently booked out to this processing node (denoted
by the local hostname). Jobs are returned as objects which implement the
Netdisco job instance interface (see below).

=head2 jq_queued( $job_type )

Returns a list of IP addresses of devices which currently have a job of the
given C<$job_type> queued (e.g. C<discover>, C<arpnip>, etc).

=head2 jq_warm_thrusters()

Performs initialisation of the Job Queue backend.

=head2 jq_log()

Returns a list of the most recent jobs as defined in C<jobs_qdepth> from the
queue. Jobs are returned as objects which implement the Netdisco job instance
interface (see below).

=head2 jq_userlog( $user )

Returns a list of jobs which have been entered into the queue by the passed
C<$user>. Jobs are returned as objects which implement the Netdisco job
instance interface (see below).

=head2 jq_lock( $job )

Marks a job in the queue as booked out to this processing node (denoted by the
local hostname). The C<$job> parameter must be an object which implements the
Netdisco job instance interface (see below).

Returns true if successful else returns false.

=head2 jq_defer( $job )

Marks a job in the queue as available for taking. This is usually done after a
job is booked but the processing node changes its mind and decides to return
the job to the queue. The C<$job> parameter must be an object which implements
the Netdisco job instance interface (see below).

Returns true if successful else returns false.

=head2 jq_complete( $job )

Marks a job as complete. The C<$job> parameter must be an object which
implements the Netdisco job instance interface (see below). The queue item's
status, log and finished fields will be updated from the passed C<$job>.

Returns true if successful else returns false.

=head2 jq_insert( \%job | [ \%job, \%job ...] )

Adds the passed jobs to the queue.

=head2 jq_delete( $id? )

If passed the ID of a job, deletes it from the queue. Otherwise deletes ALL
jobs from the queue.
